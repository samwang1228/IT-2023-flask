lyric:Hello, it's meI was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meetTo go over everythingThey say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healingHello, can you hear me?I'm in California dreaming about who we used to beWhen we were younger and freeI've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feetThere's such a difference between usAnd a million milesHello from the other sideI must've called a thousand timesTo tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've doneBut when I call, you never seem to be homeHello from the outsideAt least I can say that I've triedTo tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heartBut it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymoreHello, how are you?It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorryI hope that you're wellDid you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?It's no secret that the both of usAre running out of timeSo hello from the other side (other side)I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've doneBut when I call, you never seem to be homeHello from the outside (outside)At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heartBut it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs)Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs)Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs)Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs)Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)Hello from the other side (other side)I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've doneBut when I call, you never seem to be homeHello from the outside (outside)At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heartBut it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
