lyric:Here comes a waveMeant to wash me awayA tide that is taking me underSwallowing sandLeft with nothing to sayMy voice drowned out in the thunderBut I won't cryAnd I won't start to crumbleWhenever they tryTo shut me or cut me downI won't be silencedYou can't keep me quietWon't tremble when you try itAll I know is I won't go speechless'Cause I'll breatheWhen they try to suffocate meDon't you underestimate me'Cause I know that I won't go speechlessWritten in stoneEvery rule, every wordCenturies old and unbendingStay in your placeBetter seen and not heardBut now that story is ending'Cause II cannot start to crumbleSo come on and tryTry to shut me and cut me downI won't be silencedYou can't keep me quietWon't tremble when you try itAll I know is I won't go speechlessSpeechlessLet the storm inI cannot be brokenNo, I won't live unspoken'Cause I know that I won't go speechlessTry to lock me in this cageI won't just lay me down and dieI will take these broken wingsAnd watch me burn across the skyHear the echoes saying IWon't be silencedThough you want to see me tremble when you try itAll I know is I won't go speechlessSpeechless'Cause I'll breatheWhen they try to suffocate meDon't you underestimate me'Cause I know that I won't go speechlessAll I know is I won't go speechlessSpeechless
